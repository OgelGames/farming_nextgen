tm3 for painting the seeder texture



Dependencies:

If technic mod is present:

This mod will give you the rechargeable
seeder.

Put any seed on the right side of it in the hotbar
and leftclick on a clean piece of soil. 
All soil will be seeded with your choosen seed while
all weed will be removed before, if any.



If technic mod is not present:

You will be able to craft the seeder as a tool.
Use it like the technic tool above.

As technic is not present you cannot recharge your tool.
But some flints in the place where you usually put seeds.
right_click with the seeder in the hand to repair your
device. 5 flints will restore full wearout.
